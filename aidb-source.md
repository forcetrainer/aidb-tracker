## **The Resolution Foundation**

### **The Rules & Structure**

* 
**The Format**: 10 weekend projects.


* 
**The Goal**: Build workflows you will still be using in 6 months.


* 
**Why It Works**: Projects force outputs instead of theory, are modular so you can skip or reorder them, and compound as later weekends reuse earlier builds.


* 
**Weekly Scorecard**: Rate each project (1–5) on Outcome Quality and Time Saved. Track Repeatability, if you will use it again, and notes on what did or didn't work.



### **Day Zero: Infrastructure Setup**

* 
**Timing**: 30–60 minutes before your first weekend.


* 
**Why Day Zero Matters**: Weekends should be about doing the work, not fighting folder structures. Get infrastructure out of the way to focus on building.


* **Tasks**:
* 
**Create Launchpad**: Build an "AI Resolution" folder with subfolders for each of the 10 weekends.


* 
**Account Initialization**: Set up accounts for AI Models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini), Info Processing (NotebookLM, Gamma), Automation (Lindy, n8n, Make), App Building (Google AI Studio), and Building tools (Replit, Lovable, Cursor).

## **The 10-Weekend Roadmap**

### **Weekend 1: The Vibe Code Kickoff**

* 
**Goal**: Build Your Resolution Tracker.


* 
**Deliverable**: A working web app that tracks your progress through these 10 weekends.


* 
**The Work**: Use Replit Agent, Lovable, or Cursor to create a tracker with 10 weekend checkboxes, a notes field, and a progress bar. Deploy it live.


* 
**Why This Goes First**: You start by proving you can build functional tools with AI. The psychological shift from "I'm not a coder" to "I built this" makes everything else possible.


* 
**Advanced**: Add user authentication, build as a PWA, or add time-tracking and "suggest next weekend" logic.


* 
**Done When**: Your tracker is live, you've logged Weekend 1, and you trust you’ll use it.



### **Weekend 2: The Model Mapping Project**

* 
**Goal**: Build Your Personal AI Topography.


* 
**Deliverable**: Model Topography Sheet and an "AI Rules of Thumb" document.


* 
**The Work**: Run the same task (Research, Writing, Strategy, Data, Visual) through Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Compare which felt right or was faster. Create a one-page "Rules of Thumb" (e.g., "Claude for drafts, ChatGPT for code").


* 
**Why It Matters**: Most people default to one model, leaving capability on the table. The goal is developing your own instincts for which "brain" works best for specific tasks.


* 
**Advanced**: Test specialized tools like Perplexity or track "editing time" needed per model.


* 
**Done When**: You can answer "which tool do I use for what?" in 30 seconds without hesitation.



### **Weekend 3: The Deep Research Sprint**

* 
**Goal**: Let AI do a week's research in an afternoon.


* 
**Deliverable**: A 2-page research brief with a clear recommendation on a real decision.


* 
**The Work**: Pick a real decision you need to make. Use deep research modes in major AI tools. Push back and ask for disconfirming evidence—don't accept the first output.


* 
**Why It Matters**: Deep research is a capability many have heard of but few have stress-tested. This weekend closes the gap between "AI can do research" and "I trust this enough to make a decision".


* 
**Advanced**: Run the question through all 3 major tools and create a meta-analysis of which was most accurate.


* 
**Done When**: Your brief leads to a recommendation you'd actually follow.



### **Weekend 4: The Analysis Project**

* 
**Goal**: Turn messy data into actual decisions.


* 
**Deliverable**: A cleaned dataset and a one-page Insights Memo with specific actions.


* 
**The Work**: Gather real data (CSV/spreadsheet) from Spotify, bank, or Google Takeout. Use AI to propose cleaning steps and 5–10 metrics. Produce a summary table and 3 specific actions.


* 
**Why It Matters**: Most people hit a gap between knowing AI can analyze data and actually doing it. Most have never uploaded their own data to push into "what should I do about this?" territory.


* 
**Advanced**: Build a reusable prompt template for monthly updates or connect to a live data source.


* 
**Done When**: You can name the top 3 drivers of your data and your planned response.



### **Weekend 5: The Visual Reasoning Project**

* 
**Goal**: Make AI see and think.


* 
**Deliverable**: One infographic, diagram, or visual explainer you'd actually use.


* 
**The Work**: Pick a process, framework, or timeline. Ask AI for the best logic to visualize it and generate 2 alternate design approaches (e.g., flowchart vs. matrix). Build it using AI or tools like Canva/Gamma.


* 
**Why This Matters**: Most use AI just to "make pictures". Real visual reasoning is about explaining complex ideas instantly through logic and visual communication.


* 
**Advanced**: Create a reusable visual system or a "visual pattern library" (2x2s, cycles, flows).


* 
**Done When**: You can explain the idea faster with the visual than with words.



### **Weekend 6: The Information Pipeline**

* 
**Goal**: Build your NotebookLM + Gamma stack.


* 
**Deliverable**: A reusable workflow: Summary + FAQ + Presentation Deck from one input source.


* 
**The Work**: Input a corpus (transcript, report, notes) into NotebookLM to generate a summary, glossary, and audio overview. Use Gamma to create an 8–12 slide deck with clear recommendations.


* 
**Why This Matters**: NotebookLM and Gamma are criminally underused. This weekend builds them into your workflow to turn raw, messy information into polished outputs without manual grind.


* 
**Advanced**: Build a full repurposing pipeline for social media or create a reusable checklist template.


* 
**Done When**: You can brief someone on the material in under 7 minutes using your deck.



### **Weekend 7: The First Automation**

* 
**Goal**: Build your content distribution machine.


* 
**Deliverable**: One working automation handling production or distribution plus a "How It Works" doc.


* 
**The Work**: Use Lindy, n8n, or Make to build a workflow with a Trigger, Transform, Route, Approval, and Logging step. Example: Notion note -> Summarize -> Draft Tweets -> Send to Slack.


* 
**Why It Matters**: This is where leverage starts compounding. One automation that saves 30 minutes per piece of content equals massive time back over a year.


* 
**Advanced**: Chain multiple automations or add conditional logic for different content types.


* 
**Done When**: You’ve run it twice successfully, it saved you time, and you can explain it.



### **Weekend 8: The Second Automation**

* 
**Goal**: Build your productivity workflow.


* 
**Deliverable**: One working productivity automation plus a follow-up dashboard or tracker.


* 
**The Work**: Pick an Inbox Follow-up bot or Meeting Prep bot. Use Lindy, n8n, or Make to check calendar events, LinkedIn lookups, and history to send a briefing 30 minutes before meetings.


* 
**Why This Matters**: Weekend 7 was about creating output; this is about managing input. Together, they create a minimum viable automation stack that prevents things from falling through the cracks.


* 
**Advanced**: Add a feedback loop to rate output quality or connect it to a CRM.


* 
**Done When**: The system creates follow-ups automatically and you have a tracker of open items.



### **Weekend 9: The Context Engineering Project**

* 
**Goal**: Build your Personal AI Operating System.


* 
**Deliverable**: A structured personal context system and a Professional Context Document for copy-pasting.


* 
**The Work**: Create sections in Notion/Obsidian for a Playbook, Artifacts Library, and logs. Write a Context Doc detailing your Role, Key Projects, Style, and "What to Avoid".


* 
**Why This Matters**: The gap between "using AI" and "having AI that knows your context" is enormous. Most people re-explain their situation every conversation; this system stops that repetition.


* 
**Advanced**: Create separate Work vs. Personal profiles or include writing samples in the context file.


* 
**Done When**: You have one place to reuse outputs and a Context Doc that improves your chats.



### **Weekend 10: The AI-Powered Build**

* 
**Goal**: Build something with AI inside it.


* 
**Deliverable**: A working application (chatbot, voice agent, or tool) that uses AI as a core feature.


* 
**The Work**: Use Google AI Studio to build the logic. Options include a chatbot trained on your expertise, a voice agent for practice, or a mini-agent for document extraction.


* 
**Why This Is Different**: Weekend 1 used AI to help you build; this weekend is about building something that *uses* AI. This is the shift from consumption to creation.


* 
**Advanced**: Build for others (team/clients) or move from a "side project" to a "prototype".


* 
**Done When**: You've deployed a tool with AI at its center that you or someone else can actually use.



---

## **Bonus Weekend: The Agent Exploration**

* 
**Goal**: Run the Agent Evaluation Gauntlet.


* 
**Deliverable**: Agent Scorecard and identified Use Cases.


* **The Gauntlet Tasks**:
1. 
**Research + Synthesis**: Process 8 links/docs into a brief.


2. 
**Operations**: Turn notes into a checklist with a timeline.


3. 
**Production**: Generate a summary, email, 5 posts, and an overview.




* 
**Why It Matters**: Agents are the future. Moving from "chatbot" to "agent" mental models requires hands-on stress testing to know their instruction-following and accuracy limits.


* 
**Advanced**: Build your own simple agent using frameworks like CrewAI or AutoGen.



---

## **Final Outcomes**

10 weekends from now, you will have built personal tracker code, two active automations, a deployed AI tool, and a full personal AI OS.

**More importantly, you will have**:

* Confidence that you can build things.


* Workflows you’ll actually keep using.


* A system that compounds over time.
