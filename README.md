# AI Resolution 2026

A collection of weekend projects to build AI fluency through hands-on building. Each weekend delivers a working tool or workflow you'll actually keep using.

Based on the principle: *"This isn't about learning AI. It's about making AI work for how you already work."*

## The Projects

| Weekend | Project | Status | Description |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | [Resolution Tracker](./week-01/tracker/) | Done | Build a web app to track progress through these 10 weekends |
| 2 | Model Mapping | Coming Soon | Create your personal AI topography and "Rules of Thumb" |
| 3 | Deep Research Sprint | Coming Soon | Let AI do a week's research in an afternoon |
| 4 | Analysis Project | Coming Soon | Turn messy data into actual decisions |
| 5 | Visual Reasoning | Coming Soon | Make AI see and think with diagrams and infographics |

| Bonus | Agent Exploration | Coming Soon | Run the Agent Evaluation Gauntlet |

## Weekly Scorecard

Each project is rated on:
- **Outcome Quality** (1-5): How good was the final result?
- **Time Saved** (1-5): How much time did AI save vs. doing it manually?
- **Repeatability** (1-5): Will you use this workflow again?

## Getting Started

Each week's project has its own README with setup instructions. Start with [Week 1: Resolution Tracker](./week-01/tracker/) to build the app that tracks your progress through the rest.

## Deployment

Projects that are web apps (like Week 1) can be deployed to Vercel:
1. Import this repo at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Set the **Root Directory** to the specific project (e.g., `week-01/tracker`)
3. Add any required environment variables
4. Deploy
